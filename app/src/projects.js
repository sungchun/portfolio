        text, and the player types text commands to play the game.\
        This project was very challenging as there were many problems that I had never faced before. In\
        order to create this project, I designed a makeshift game engine to create the game's core\
        mechanics. Afterward, all of the game content that was written just had to be plugged into the game.\
        Other challenges that I faced were: creating the text-based interactivity, coding some of the\
        commands such as 'COMBINE' and 'WALKTO', and creating the save feature.",

         This project was completed in a group of 3, my job was to implement the Mapbox API to display an\
         interactive map. Using the Mapbox documentation, I successfully created an interactive map component\
         that displayed markers using geocoded addresses. It also includes a 'fly to' feature, where the user\
         can fly the map to selected locations.",
